# Final Game
Go Marble! is a fast-paced physics driven marble game, where a player races through different levels and utilizes different game-mechanics to reach their goal. There are nine levels each of which is short and sweet and can be completed in less than a minute. 

Each level presents a use of a specific game-mechanic, such as, making use of power ups to cross large gaps or reach higher platforms, moving platforms, instant-death-blocks, along with some difficulty scaling as well. Finishing a level will reward the player with a medal depending on how fast they completed the level. 

Try to beat all the levels as fast as possible to achieve a gold medal, and even faster just for bragging rights. To make this less tedious, players are able to directly restart the level through the pause menu, and also return to level select any time if they want to play a different level.

If the device is not performant enough to handle the use of post processing or the game is too loud, change this within the options menu which is accessible during gameplay when pausing and on the main menu. 

If players are not satisfied with the default marble skin, they can personalize their marble with different marble skins, trails, and accessories. The marble can become a glowing sphere or be made of glass. trails can be changed to different colors or even some weirder patterns. Accessories can give the marble a cone as a hat, or make a duck sitting on top the marble. There are many more skins, trails and accessories to try out in the game.

The game features a futuristic cyberpunk aesthetic with neon lights that didn’t require many custom textures and was easy to implement with the material tools in unity like shader graphs.

## Cutting room floor
In the beginning we were very ambitious and wanted to implement a lot of features, but not all ended up in the final build, and at the end wanted something that worked with what we currently had implemented and something we really wanted to include.

The area we probably were the most ambitious about was the level count. We wanted around 20 levels but that was before we realised how time consuming it was to make a whole level even with probuilder. The game ended up with 9 levels in total and we ensured all our features were used and showcased somehow in the levels (except ice)

Here is a list of some of the features we cut:
- Leaderboards
- Enemy
- Cheat Codes
- Collectibles
- Checkpoints
- Progression (levels and cosmetics unlock)

## Conclusion
Overall, the project ended up great, and we made a functioning game that we feel is fun to play. We had some problems with scope and bit off more than we should have, and so we didn’t get to implement every feature, but the project benefited from the improved focus on the important parts. The restrictions of having the game work on an arcade machine with limited resources made the development process more challenging, and made us more careful with some of our implementations.
