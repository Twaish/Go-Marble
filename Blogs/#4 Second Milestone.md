# Missed Milestones
We bit off more than we could chew and di not complete half of the milestone we set. We still want to include the features but now we also need to think of if we need to cut some of the points, since we are nearing the final handin date.
- Some power ups (2-3)
- Spike/Deathblocks
- Medal System
- Leaderboards
- Skin unlocks
<br>\+ Update jumping mecahnics

The only one of these we might want to remove would be the skin unlock system, since the skins could just be made available without any unlock conditions.

# Gravity Shift Area ✓
We could not get the camera to work the way we wanted it to with the anti-gravity areas. We did end up with something we can use on a level, just not what we originally wanted. We can make a gravity zone around a sphere and have a level where the player needs to jump from planet to planet.

# + Moving platforms ✓
We made a prefab for a movign platform and moving obstacle. It contains an empty parent with 3 children: the platform and 2 empty game objects that acts as point A and B. We then use a script to make the platform tween between the 2. The prefab also needed a rigidbody component for it to handle collisions with the player correctly. If the speed is high enough the obstacle could just move right through the player if there wasn't a rigidbody component.

# + Basic skins ✓
We made a couple of simple skins to pick between. Though they are not implemented yet.
We made 14 textures, some we made ourselves, some came from googleimages but were modified and some from an image generation AI.

# + UI functionality ✓
Somewhat works. Users can navigate to the different menus, but no level loading has been implemented.

# + Gameplay UI (Powerup slot, Timer, etc.) ✓
This task is finished, as both the powerup slot and the timer has been added to the game ui. Timer functionality works, but no powerup slot functionality yet, as the system is not in place yet.

# Third Milestone

<br>\+ Make playable on the VIA arcade
<br>\+ Some power ups (2-3)
<br>\+ Spike/Deathblocks

<br>\+ Add Trails and accessories to the skin selection
